Cools has just created what he prides as "The only Non-Module Lua Player .20 with System Over/Under Clocking/Quitting Features with Netlib 2.0 Support!". And although this Lua Player .20 mod is more a copy and paste project, you still have to admire cools for some of the minor modifications he's made. This custom lua player adds some of the functions from Lua Player .17dk_2 and youresam's netlib version plus all the functions - except module loading - included in Lua Player .20. There is no Applications Folder in this mod so if you want to have that, just download Lua Player v0.20 (download provided below) and replace the Eboot. Here are the functions added in this custom lua player: System Functions: System.Quit() --Will quit to the Game Menu on 1.5 and to eLoader on 2.XX System.setCpuSpeedVHigh() --Sets CPU to 333 Mhz System.setCpuSpeedHigh() --Sets CPU to 300 Mhz System.setCpuSpeedMed() --Sets CPU to 266 Mhz System.setCpuSpeedReg() --Sets CPU to 222 Mhz System.setCpuSpeedLow() --Sets CPU to 200 Mhz System.setCpuSpeedVLow() --Sets CPU to 100 Mhz Netlib 2.0 UDP functions: Socket.udpConnect(host,port) udpSocket:udpSend(string) udpSocket:close() udpSocket:recv() Cools noted that the function "System.setCpuSpeedVHigh() --Sets CPU to 333 Mhz" has actually slowed some of his games so he asks all who's going to try out this game to let him know if you suffer the same fate. To get of the rest of the Netlib functions, cools advises us to use the netlib.lua file - the developer hopes to add other functions like netget(id) and netclose() pretty soon. Also in the works is setting of CPU to System.setCpuClock(333,333,166), but cools himself doubt it will happen. The good developer warns that this Lua Player v0.20 mod has not been tested on a 1.5 only on 2.00 tiff. Another warning, "Serial I/O MIGHT have been disabled" with this application.
